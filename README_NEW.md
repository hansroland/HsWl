# HsWl Haskell Wayland Client


The project has the following subdirectories:

## 0_Book

This is the original code of the [Wayland Book](https://github.com/rcalixte/wayland-book/blob/master/src/SUMMARY.md). At the time of writing, the [original version](https://wayland-book.com/) was no longer accessible.

#### Status

Currently this directory contains the code upto the chapter [example-code](https://github.com/rcalixte/wayland-book/blob/master/src/xdg-shell-basics/example-code.md)

#### TODO

Add additional requests from the folllowing chapters

## 1_FFI

This directory contains a more or less simple translation of the code in the `Book` directory from C to Haskell. I think the result is rather clumsy. Therefore I won't add additional code.

#### Status

At the moment, the code up to the extended example has been translated to Haskell. However the checkerboard background has not been implemented.

## 2_Generator

This directory contains a generator application to generate Haskell functions for the Wayland request and event-handling functions from the defining xml files.

#### Status

The generator is



## 3_Client
